## Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Register a new application at [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)
   - Set OAuth Redirect URL to: `http://localhost:5173`
3. Get your credentials:
   - Client ID from your Twitch application

**Important**: Never commit the `.env` file to version control!

## Environment Variables

This project requires several environment variables to function properly. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
VITE_TWITCH_CHANNEL=your_channel_name
VITE_TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
VITE_TWITCH_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
```

For deployment:
1. Never commit the `.env` file
2. Add these variables as repository secrets in GitHub:
   - Go to Repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and Variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Add each variable as a new secret
   - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically use these secrets during deployment
